# Overshoot-Aware Damping (Oct 23, 2025)

# Context: v0.1.0 showed DM recovery caused indoor 23.6°C vs target 21.5°C

# Anti-Windup Protection (Dec 9, 2025)
# ============================================================================
# Description:
#   Prevents DM oscillation caused by "chasing" thermal debt in UFH systems.
#   When offset is positive (adding heat), DM goes MORE negative initially
#   because S1 target rises but BT25 (actual) takes hours to catch up.
#
# Problem (Classic Integral Windup):
#   1. DM at -300 → System applies +2°C offset
#   2. S1 target jumps up immediately
#   3. BT25 takes 3-6 hours to catch up (concrete slab thermal lag)
#   4. DM drops to -500 (gap is now bigger!) → "Not working, add more!"
#   5. Offset raised to +3°C → DM drops to -700 (even worse!)
#   6. Eventually heat reaches slab, BT25 overshoots S1
#   7. DM swings to +100 (positive overshoot)
#   8. System backs off → cycle repeats
#
# Solution (Anti-Windup Logic):
#   If DM is dropping WHILE current_offset is already positive:
#   → Heat is "in transit" through the thermal mass
#   → DON'T escalate offset further - wait for heat to arrive
#   → Cap offset at current level until DM stabilizes or improves
#
# Key Insight:
#   Raising offset doesn't fix DM immediately - it makes DM WORSE temporarily!
#   Correct behavior: Set reasonable offset and WAIT for thermal lag.
#
# All parameters below are DERIVED from existing constants, not static values.
# This ensures consistency across the codebase and adapts to configuration.
#
# Reference:
#   - Wikipedia: Integral Windup
#   - Thermal mass buffers: DM_THERMAL_MASS_BUFFER_* (1.0 to 1.3)
#   - Update interval: UPDATE_INTERVAL_MINUTES (5 min default)
# ============================================================================

# DM drop rate threshold to detect "dropping while heating"
#
# Math derivation:
#   DM = ∫(BT25 - S1) dt, accumulated in °C·minutes
#   When offset is raised by X°C, S1 target rises immediately
#   But BT25 (actual flow) takes hours to catch up (thermal lag)
#   During lag: gap ≈ X°C → DM drops at X × 60 = X·60 DM/hour
#
#   Example: +2°C offset raise → gap ~2°C → DM drops ~120 DM/hour
#   Example: +1°C offset raise → gap ~1°C → DM drops ~60 DM/hour
#
# Threshold: -50 DM/hour = ~0.8°C sustained gap = clear "heat in transit" signal
# Lowered from -60 to -50 (Dec 18, 2025) to catch borderline cases where
# heat is clearly in transit but rate is just above threshold.
# This avoids false positives from normal ±0.3°C fluctuations (~18 DM/h)
#
# Reference: NIBE DM formula from F750 Service Manual Menu 4.9.3
ANTI_WINDUP_DM_DROPPING_RATE: Final = -50.0  # DM/hour (≈0.8°C gap between S1 and BT25)

# Base history size for anti-windup DM tracking (30 minutes = 6 samples at 5-min intervals)
# This is scaled by DM_THERMAL_MASS_BUFFER_* in EmergencyLayer.__init__
# Concrete (×1.3): 6 × 1.3 ≈ 8 samples = 40 min history
# Timber (×1.15): 6 × 1.15 ≈ 7 samples = 35 min history
# Radiator (×1.0): 6 samples = 30 min history
ANTI_WINDUP_DM_HISTORY_BASE_SIZE: Final = 6  # Base samples, scaled by thermal mass buffer

# Minimum samples needed to calculate reliable DM trend
# At least 15 minutes of data (3 samples at 5-min intervals)

# Minimum positive offset to trigger anti-windup check
# Below this, we're not actively pushing recovery hard enough to cause windup

# When anti-windup is active, cap offset at this fraction of current offset

# ============================================================================
# Thermal Mass Buffer Multipliers (DM Threshold Adjustment)
# ============================================================================
# Description:
#   High thermal mass systems need tighter DM thresholds to maintain thermal
#   buffer for forecast uncertainty. Long thermal lag (6+ hours for concrete)
#   means current DM doesn't immediately affect indoor temp.
#
# Research Context:
#   - v0.1.0 failure: DM -700 during solar gain → 1.5°C drop at sunset
#   - Concrete slab thermal lag: 6-12 hours
#   - Need buffer to handle: sunset, weather changes, forecast errors
#
# Multiplier Logic:
#   Applied to base climate-aware thresholds from ClimateZoneDetector
#   Example: Stockholm at 10°C → base warning -276
#            Concrete: -276 × 1.3 = -359 (tighter threshold)
#            Radiator: -276 × 1.0 = -276 (standard)
#
# Example Impact (Stockholm at 10°C):
#   Base thresholds: normal_max=-276, warning=-276, critical=-1500
#
#   Concrete slab (6-12h lag):
#     normal_max: -276 × 1.3 = -359
#     warning:    -276 × 1.3 = -359
#     critical:   -1500 (unchanged, absolute maximum)
#     → Activates T1 recovery earlier, maintains thermal buffer
#
#   Timber UFH (2-4h lag):
#     normal_max: -276 × 1.15 = -317
#     warning:    -276 × 1.15 = -317
#     critical:   -1500 (unchanged)
#     → Moderate tightening for medium-lag systems
#
#   Radiators (<1h lag):
#     normal_max: -276 × 1.0 = -276
#     warning:    -276 × 1.0 = -276
#     critical:   -1500 (unchanged)
#     → Standard thresholds, fast response allows more latitude

# Weather prediction layer - Simplified proactive pre-heating (Oct 20, 2025)
# Philosophy: "The heating we add NOW shows up in 6 hours - pre-heat BEFORE cold arrives"
#
# Problem: Concrete slab 6-hour thermal lag causes reactive heating to arrive too late,
#          resulting in thermal debt spirals (DM -1000) followed by 26°C overshoot.
#
# Solution: Simple forecast-based pre-heating scaled by thermal mass:
#   - Forecast ≥4°C drop in next 12h → +0.6°C gentle pre-heat
#   - Indoor cooling ≥0.5°C/h → confirms forecast, maintains +0.6°C
#   - Weight scaled by thermal mass: Concrete 1.28x, Timber 0.85x, Radiator 0.43x
#   - Let SAFETY, COMFORT, EFFECT layers moderate naturally via weighted aggregation
#
# Real-world validation: Prevents 20:00→04:00 emergency cycles and 16:00 overshoot

# Airflow Optimizer Constants (Exhaust Air Heat Pump)
# ============================================================================
# Description:
#   Original thermodynamic calculations for exhaust air heat pump airflow optimization.
#   Enhanced airflow extracts more heat from exhaust air, improving COP when conditions
#   are favorable. Based on first-principles energy balance.
#
# Physics:
#   Net Benefit = (Extra heat extracted) + (COP improvement) - (Ventilation penalty)
#   Q_extract = ṁ × cp × ΔT = (flow_m³h / 3600) × 1.2 kg/m³ × 1.005 kJ/kg·K × 12°C
#   COP_enhanced ≈ 1.20 × COP_standard (warmer evaporator from enhanced airflow)
#   Q_penalty = ṁ × cp × (T_indoor - T_outdoor)
#
# When Enhanced Airflow Helps:
#   Outdoor °C | Min Compressor % | Expected Gain
#   +10        | 50%              | +1.3 kW
#   0          | 50%              | +0.9 kW
#   -5         | 62%              | +0.7 kW
#   -10        | 75%              | +0.4 kW
